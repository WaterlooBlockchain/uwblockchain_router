# Goals of this project
- Understand the fundamental concepts behind routing in web3
- Learn about best practices in web3 development
- Document and share our findings as much as possible
- Build a dApp with a React frontend similar to 1inch to showcase our findings

# Environment

In order to simplify the developer experience, we will be using devcontainers.

You will need to install these following tools:
- Docker
- VSCode
- Devcontainer extension on VSCode

There are multiple advantages of using a container based workflow, and you can read more on https://containers.dev/ 

After installing these tools/extensions:
- Open the project in vscode
- Open the Command Palette and run the ```Dev Containers: Open Folder in Container``` command
- Wait for the container to be created, and do ```npm install``` in the integrated terminal
- Profit???
